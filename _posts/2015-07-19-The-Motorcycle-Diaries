  I remember watching this surprisingly beautiful documentary called The Motorcycle Diaries, based in the 1950s and it touched me beyond words!
  It captures the life-changing journey of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara into most parts of Latin America and how he left medicine and fought against economic disparities and social injustice.

  *Spoiler alert*
  He, and Alberto Granado, left on a motorcycle, set out to enjoy, but it so happened that the encounters during the journey were so touching that it turned their lives around. The stark realities of the society hit them in the eye, and they saw a sea change in their perception of life and the world around them.

  I wonder if I will ever be lucky enough to experience such a journey.

They came across a communist couple rendered homeless because of the fact, and this is when it all began! The doctors felt ashamed that they were on the road for leisure, not for a reason as sorrowful. Guevara gave them the only 
money they had and accompanied them to the copper mines, where they saw yet another form of oppression - ill treatment of the mine workers. With the birth of the anti-capitalist rigour inside him, he responded violently to the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeosis.

  Next, they headed to Peru and the remains of the Incan civilization. The Spanish invaded the Incas Empire, and took away everything. Struck by the unimaginable impact of colonisation, Granado told Guevara that he wanted to transform entire Latin America by means of a peaceful revolution. The anti-imperialist Guevara, however, responded instantly, saying that a revolution without force would not be successful.

  Towards the end of their journey, they volunteered to serve leprosy-affected people in San Pablo. Guevara felt sick looking at the poor people packed in small, filthy boats while travelling in spacious, luxurious boats himself and othe rhigh class officials.

  When they reached the island, they saw that the Amazon River segregated the ill from the healthy. The leper patients lived across the river and were treated like untouchables, even though the disease is not highly contagious. Neither of them complied with the "rules" of the island, and treated the leper patients with all their heart.

  On the last day of their stay, he gave voice to his egalitarian ideology by raising a toast, to Peru and for a United America. He vouched for a just society with no distinctions whatsoever. he wished to celebrate his birthday and share the joy with the people on the other side of the river too. Despite his severe asthma, he jumped into the water and swam across the river to reach the other side, with the leper patients cheering him on!
</p>

<p>
Isn't it just amazing how every form of discrimination crossed their path and they grew from mere oblivious citizens to revolutionaries! Honestly, I have never fully appreciated people like Guevara never having seen that world with my own eyes. 
This documentary made me feel something. It's a start :)
</p>

<p>
  The biggest takeaway for me is the inspiration, that there have been great people, who did great things in life. I'd consider myself successful if I could make an impact even remotely close to theirs'.

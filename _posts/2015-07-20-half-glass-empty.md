  Just one of those days when you feel... substance-less. The realization that you have been lagging behind.
  You know what I mean, don't you?
</p>

<p>
  Like there is so much to do in life. And you've done so little.
  There is so much to learn. And you've learned so little.
  There is so much to see. And you've seen so little.
  Time seems to race with you, and beats you every time.
</p>

<p>
  I have been in this mode on and off for quite a while now. Staying away from the oddly "safe" environment of family, and toss in low self-esteem - and you have found yourself in a bottomles pit of self-loathing. 
</p>
<p>
Good news is, I finally got out of my slumber and started acting upon it.
  I am completing pending tasks, blurring the line between plan and action, having meaningful conversations with friends, teasing my brain with puzzles, and even watching inspiring movies about world renowned people. </br>
Bad news is, the more I am reading, the more I realize how far behind I am. (Hence, the half-glass-empty feeling) And I cannot help but regret how I let my focus dwindle for most parts of the past year. And the most stiffling realization - there is no one else to blame.
</p>

<p>
So I have decided that it is never too late for resolutions. My mid-year resolution is to get back in control of my life. I am going to bring back the super-passionate, the ever-ready self back. I miss my self-inspiring self. </br>
I have set achievable targets for everyday (short-term goals to begin with) and I am following them religiously.
I am fixinf everything that makes me less confident. Cannot stay in this hitherto unknown territory anymore.
I am coding more, I am reading more, I am writing more. I am challenging myself more.
</br>
I am finally regaining my balance.
</P>

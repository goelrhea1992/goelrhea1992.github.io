      Hi, there. I would best describe myself as a thinker; curious, and a seeker by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not float with the tide, but I do not swim for A goal either.
      Unlike most people of the 21st century, I am not ambitious. 
      I'm rather passionate, about several little things. I strongly believe that we're constantly changing, growing with the world around us. 
      Each one of us, in our own different way. Every moment in life changes our perspective, and our goals take a different shape.
      why would I chase something so temporary?
    </p>

      I grew up in Delhi, India as part of an extraordinary, loving family. My mother, has been the greatest inspiration of my life and will remain so.
      I will forever be indebted to her, and God, for an exceptional education till date. 
      
      I went to IIIT Delhi, for my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and haven't looked back ever since.
      I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Columbia University, New York.
      
      I've always strived for the most bizarre thing sin life, with the gut feeling that "I might just get it".
      Am I the luckiest person on Earth or what?

<p>
Those were the best days of my liiife! Indeed.
</p>

<p>
Aaaand for the summer of 2015, I found myself in the beautiful city of Seattle, while working at Amazon Inc., as an intern.
</p>

<p>
Let's call my team Cryptic-Cat to not risk a lawsuit from (spoiler alert) my future employer.
The cryptic-cats are some of the smartest people I know, who created and manage the biggest NoSQL data store on the planet!
</p>

<p>
For my intern project, I wrote a REST API to run ad hoc performance tests on the huge-ass backend store that amazon.com runs on, 
in a highly distributed environment and serve a GUI tool that visualizes test metrics, and gives test progress in real time.
The service was written in Python, using Flask web framework with DynamoDB and S3 in the back. 
</br>
An entire software dev. project in Python. Could I _be_ any cooler?
</p>

<p>
Technically, I have added a lot to my pallete - AWS	 (DynamoDB,	 S3),	 boto,	 Flask, GWT,	D3	(javascript). Object-oriented 
programming in a scripting language such as Python was a whole new experience. In addition, I picked up a new IDE for the summer, 
and undoubtedly, I am a proud member of the IntelliJ-over-Eclipse team hereafter.
</br>
Furthermore, working with large scale distributed systems, and multi threaded programming was a major challenge, 
and my confidence in such advanced concepts has improved significantly.
</br>
Last but not the least, owning a project from design, to development; from feedback to redesign and testing, to deliver was 
an intimidating, yet engaging part of my internship.
</br>
Overall, I believe I have done fairly well in an entirely new role, 
with an overwhelming set of new tools at hand, in an immensely quality-driven environment.
</p>

<p>
This is not all that the cryptic-cats gave me this summer. I 
What can I say - it was a summer of firsts. And firsts might be often scary, but are almost always exciting.

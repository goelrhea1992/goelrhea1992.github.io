      Hi, there. I would best describe myself as a thinker; curious, and a seeker by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not float with the tide, but I do not swim for A goal either.
      Unlike most people of the 21st century, I am not ambitious. 
      I'm rather passionate, about several little things. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of us is constantly changing, in our own different way. Our persepectives change, and goals reshape.
      Why would I chase something so temporary?
    </p>

      I grew up in Delhi, India as part of an extraordinary, loving family. My mother, has been the greatest inspiration of my life and will remain so.
      I will forever be indebted to her, and God, for an exceptional education till date. 
   </p>
   <p>
   	I went to IIIT Delhi, for my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and haven't looked back ever since.
      I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Columbia University, New York.
   </p>
      
      <p>
      	I've always strived for the most bizarre things in life, with the gut feeling that "I might just get it".
      Am I the luckiest person on Earth or what?
